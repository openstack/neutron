    the router.

    came in with the timestamp.

    it effectively signals to the thread that is working on the router that
    something has changed since it started working on it.  That thread will
    simply finish its current iteration and then repeat.

    processed.  The timestamp that it keeps must be before when the data used
    to process the router last was fetched from the database.  But, as close as
    possible.  The timestamp should not be recorded, however, until the router
