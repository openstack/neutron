def paginate_query(query, model, limit, sorts, marker_obj=None):
    """Returns a query with sorting / pagination criteria added.

    Pagination works by requiring a unique sort key, specified by sorts.
    (If sort keys is not unique, then we risk looping through values.)
    We use the last row in the previous page as the 'marker' for pagination.
    So we must return values that follow the passed marker in the order.
    With a single-valued sort key, this would be easy: sort_key > X.
    With a compound-values sort key, (k1, k2, k3) we must do this to repeat
    the lexicographical ordering:
    (k1 > X1) or (k1 == X1 && k2 > X2) or (k1 == X1 && k2 == X2 && k3 > X3)
    The reason of didn't use OFFSET clause was it don't scale, please refer
    discussion at https://lists.launchpad.net/openstack/msg02547.html

    We also have to cope with different sort directions.

    Typically, the id of the last row is used as the client-facing pagination
    marker, then the actual marker object must be fetched from the db and
    passed in to us as marker.

    :param query: the query object to which we should add paging/sorting
    :param model: the ORM model class
    :param limit: maximum number of items to return
    :param sorts: array of attributes and direction by which results should
                 be sorted
    :param marker: the last item of the previous page; we returns the next
                    results after this value.
    :rtype: sqlalchemy.orm.query.Query
    :return: The query with sorting/pagination added.
