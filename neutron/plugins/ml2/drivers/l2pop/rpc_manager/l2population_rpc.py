    Some of the methods in this class use Local VLAN Mapping, aka lvm.

    ============ =========================================================
    Attribute    Description
    ============ =========================================================
    vlan         An identifier used by the agent to identify a neutron
                 network.
    network_type A network type found in neutron.plugins.common.constants.
    ============ =========================================================

    NOTE(yamamoto): "Local VLAN" is an OVS-agent term.  OVS-agent internally
    uses 802.1q VLAN tagging to isolate networks.  While this class inherited
    the terms from OVS-agent, it does not assume the specific underlying
    technologies.  E.g. this class is also used by ofagent, where a different
    mechanism is used.
