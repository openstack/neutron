This directory contains files that are required for the XenAPI support.
They should be installed in the XenServer / Xen Cloud Platform dom0.

If you install them manually, you will need to ensure that the newly
added files are executable. You can do this by running the following
command (from dom0):

    chmod a+x /etc/xapi.d/plugins/*

Otherwise, you can build an rpm by running the following command:

    ./contrib/build-rpm.sh

and install the rpm by running the following command (from dom0):

    rpm -i openstack-neutron-xen-plugins.rpm
