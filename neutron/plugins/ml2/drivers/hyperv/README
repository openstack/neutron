Hyper-V Neutron Agent and ML2 Mechanism Driver for ML2 Plugin
=============================================================

In order to properly use the Hyper-V Neutron Agent, neutron will have to use
the Ml2Plugin. This can be done by setting the ``core_plugin`` field in
``neutron.conf`` to:

::

    core_plugin = neutron.plugins.ml2.plugin.Ml2Plugin

Additionally, the ML2 Plugin must be configured to use the Hyper-V Mechanism
Driver, by adding it to the ``mechanism_drivers`` field in ``ml2_conf.ini``:

::

    [ml2]
    mechanism_drivers = openvswitch,hyperv
    # any other mechanism_drivers can be added to the list.

Currently, the mechanism driver supports the following network types: local,
flat, VLAN.
