The Modular Layer 2 (ml2) plugin is a framework allowing OpenStack
Networking to simultaneously utilize the variety of layer 2 networking
technologies found in complex real-world data centers. It currently
works with the existing openvswitch, linuxbridge, and hyperv L2
agents, and is intended to replace and deprecate the monolithic
plugins associated with those L2 agents. The ml2 framework is also
intended to greatly simplify adding support for new L2 networking
technologies, requiring much less initial and ongoing effort than
would be required to add a new monolithic core plugin.

Drivers within ml2 implement separately extensible sets of network
types and of mechanisms for accessing networks of those types. Unlike
with the metaplugin, multiple mechanisms can be used simultaneously to
access different ports of the same virtual network. Mechanisms can
utilize L2 agents via RPC and/or use mechanism drivers to interact
with external devices or controllers. Virtual networks can be composed
of multiple segments of the same or different types. Type and
mechanism drivers are loaded as python entrypoints using the stevedore
library.

Each available network type is managed by an ml2
TypeDriver. TypeDrivers maintain any needed type-specific network
state, and perform provider network validation and tenant network
allocation. The initial ml2 version includes drivers for the local,
flat, and vlan network types. Additional TypeDrivers for gre and vxlan
network types are expected before the havana release.

RPC callback and notification interfaces support interaction with L2,
DHCP, and L3 agents. This version has been tested with the existing
openvswitch and linuxbridge plugins' L2 agents, and should also work
with the hyperv L2 agent. A modular agent may be developed as a
follow-on effort.

Support for mechanism drivers is currently a work-in-progress in
pre-release Havana versions, and the interface is subject to change
before the release of Havana. MechanismDrivers are currently called
both inside and following DB transactions for network and port
create/update/delete operations. In a future version, they will also
called to establish a port binding, determining the VIF type and
network segment to be used.

The database schema and driver APIs support multi-segment networks,
but the client API for multi-segment networks is not yet implemented.

A devstack patch supporting use of the ml2 plugin with either the
openvswitch or linuxbridge L2 agent for the local, flat and vlan
network types is under review at
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/27576/. Note that the gre network
type and the tunnel-related RPCs are not yet implemented, so use the
vlan network type for multi-node testing. Also note that ml2 does not
yet work with nova's GenericVIFDriver, so it is necessary to configure
nova to use a specific driver compatible with the L2 agent deployed on
each compute node.

Note that the ml2 plugin is new and should be conidered experimental
at this point. It is undergoing rapid development, so driver APIs and
other details are likely to change during the havana development
cycle.

Follow-on tasks required for full ml2 support in havana, including
parity with the existing monolithic openvswitch, linuxbridge, and
hyperv plugins:

- Additional unit tests

- Implement MechanismDriver port binding so that a useful
  binding:vif_type value is returned for nova's GenericVIFDriver based
  on the binding:host_id value and information from the agents_db

- Implement TypeDriver for GRE networks

- Implement GRE tunnel endpoint management RPCs


Additional follow-on tasks expected for the havana release:

- Extend MechanismDriver API to support integration with external
  devices such as SDN controllers and top-of-rack switches

- Implement TypeDriver for VXLAN networks

- Extend providernet extension API to support multi-segment networks
