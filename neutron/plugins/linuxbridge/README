# -- Background

The Neutron Linux Bridge plugin is a plugin that allows you to manage
connectivity between VMs on hosts that are capable of running a Linux Bridge.

The Neutron Linux Bridge plugin consists of three components:

1) The plugin itself: The plugin uses a database backend (mysql for
   now) to store configuration and mappings that are used by the
   agent.  The mysql server runs on a central server (often the same
   host as nova itself).

2) The neutron service host which will be running neutron.  This can
   be run on the server running nova.

3) An agent which runs on the host and communicates with the host operating
   system. The agent gathers the configuration and mappings from
   the mysql database running on the neutron host.

The sections below describe how to configure and run the neutron
service with the Linux Bridge plugin.

# -- Python library dependencies

   Make sure you have the following package(s) installed on neutron server
   host as well as any hosts which run the agent:
   bridge-utils
   python-mysqldb
   sqlite3

# -- Nova configuration (controller node)

1) Ensure that the neutron network manager is configured in the
   nova.conf on the node that will be running nova-network.

network_manager=nova.network.neutron.manager.NeutronManager

# -- Nova configuration (compute node(s))

1) Configure the vif driver, and libvirt/vif type

connection_type=libvirt
libvirt_type=qemu
libvirt_vif_type=ethernet
libvirt_vif_driver=nova.virt.libvirt.vif.NeutronLinuxBridgeVIFDriver
linuxnet_interface_driver=nova.network.linux_net.NeutronLinuxBridgeInterfaceDriver

2) If you want a DHCP server to be run for the VMs to acquire IPs,
   add the following flag to your nova.conf file:

neutron_use_dhcp=true

(Note: For more details on how to work with Neutron using Nova, i.e. how to create networks and such,
 please refer to the top level Neutron README which points to the relevant documentation.)

# -- Neutron configuration

Make the Linux Bridge plugin the current neutron plugin

- edit neutron.conf and change the core_plugin

core_plugin = neutron.plugins.linuxbridge.lb_neutron_plugin.LinuxBridgePluginV2

# -- Database config.

(Note: The plugin ships with a default SQLite in-memory database configuration,
 and can be used to run tests without performing the suggested DB config below.)

The Linux Bridge neutron plugin requires access to a mysql database in order
to store configuration and mappings that will be used by the agent.  Here is
how to set up the database on the host that you will be running the neutron
service on.

MySQL should be installed on the host, and all plugins and clients
must be configured with access to the database.

To prep mysql, run:

$ mysql -u root -p -e "create database neutron_linux_bridge"

# log in to mysql service
$ mysql -u root -p
# The Linux Bridge Neutron agent running on each compute node must be able to
# make a mysql connection back to the main database server.
mysql> GRANT USAGE ON *.* to root@'yourremotehost' IDENTIFIED BY 'newpassword';
# force update of authorization changes
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

(Note: If the remote connection fails to MySQL, you might need to add the IP address,
 and/or fully-qualified hostname, and/or unqualified hostname in the above GRANT sql
 command. Also, you might need to specify "ALL" instead of "USAGE".)

# -- Plugin configuration

- Edit the configuration file:
  etc/neutron/plugins/linuxbridge/linuxbridge_conf.ini
  Make sure it matches your mysql configuration.  This file must be updated
  with the addresses and credentials to access the database.

  Note: debug and logging information should be updated in etc/neutron.conf

  Note: When running the tests, set the connection type to sqlite, and when
  actually running the server set it to mysql. At any given time, only one
  of these should be active in the conf file (you can comment out the other).

- On the neutron server, network_vlan_ranges must be configured in
  linuxbridge_conf.ini to specify the names of the physical networks
  managed by the linuxbridge plugin, along with the ranges of VLAN IDs
  available on each physical network for allocation to virtual
  networks. An entry of the form
  "<physical_network>:<vlan_min>:<vlan_max>" specifies a VLAN range on
  the named physical network. An entry of the form
  "<physical_network>" specifies a named network without making a
  range of VLANs available for allocation. Networks specified using
  either form are available for adminstrators to create provider flat
  networks and provider VLANs. Multiple VLAN ranges can be specified
  for the same physical network.

  The following example linuxbridge_conf.ini entry shows three
  physical networks that can be used to create provider networks, with
  ranges of VLANs available for allocation on two of them:

  [VLANS]
  network_vlan_ranges = physnet1:1000:2999,physnet1:3000:3999,physnet2,physnet3:1:4094


# -- Agent configuration

- Edit the configuration file:
  etc/neutron/plugins/linuxbridge/linuxbridge_conf.ini

- Copy neutron/plugins/linuxbridge/agent/linuxbridge_neutron_agent.py
  and etc/neutron/plugins/linuxbridge/linuxbridge_conf.ini
  to the compute node.

- Copy the neutron.conf file to the compute node

  Note: debug and logging information should be updated in etc/neutron.conf

- On each compute node, the network_interface_mappings must be
  configured in linuxbridge_conf.ini to map each physical network name
  to the physical interface connecting the node to that physical
  network. Entries are of the form
  "<physical_network>:<physical_interface>". For example, one compute
  node may use the following physical_inteface_mappings entries:

  [LINUX_BRIDGE]
  physical_interface_mappings = physnet1:eth1,physnet2:eth2,physnet3:eth3

  while another might use:

  [LINUX_BRIDGE]
  physical_interface_mappings = physnet1:em3,physnet2:em2,physnet3:em1


$ Run the following:
  python linuxbridge_neutron_agent.py --config-file neutron.conf
                                      --config-file linuxbridge_conf.ini

  Note that the the user running the agent must have sudo priviliges
  to run various networking commands. Also, the agent can be
  configured to use neutron-rootwrap, limiting what commands it can
  run via sudo. See http://wiki.openstack.org/Packager/Rootwrap for
  details on rootwrap.

  As an alternative to coping the agent python file, if neutron is
  installed on the compute node, the agent can be run as
  bin/neutron-linuxbridge-agent.
