      Convention for heading levels in Neutron devref:
      =======  Heading 0 (reserved for the title in a document)
      -------  Heading 1
      ~~~~~~~  Heading 2
      +++++++  Heading 3
      '''''''  Heading 4
      (Avoid deeper levels because they do not render well.)


Neutron Stadiun i18n
====================

* Refer to oslo_i18n documentation for the general mechanisms that should
  be used: http://docs.openstack.org/developer/oslo.i18n/usage.html

* Do NOT use the _i18n module in neutron-lib or neutron.

* It is recommended that you create a {package_name}/_i18n.py file
  in your repo, and use that. Your localization strings will also live
  in your repo.

* The neutron.i18n module will be around for a release or two, with
  shared localization strings, but migration is encouraged.
