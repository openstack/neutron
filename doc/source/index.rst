Welcome to Quantum's developer documentation!
=============================================

Quantum is an OpenStack project to provide "network connectivity as a service"
between interface devices (e.g., vNICs) managed by other Openstack services
(e.g., nova). It implements the `Quantum API Guide`_.

.. _`Quantum API Guide`: http://docs.openstack.org/incubation/openstack-network/developer/quantum-api-1.0/content/

This document describes Quantum for contributors of the project, and assumes
that you are already familiar with Quantum from an `end-user perspective`_.

.. _`end-user perspective`: http://docs.openstack.org/trunk/openstack-network/admin/content/index.html

This documentation is generated by the Sphinx toolkit and lives in the source
tree.  Additional documentation on Quantum and other components of OpenStack
can be found on the `OpenStack wiki`_. The `Quantum Development wiki`_ is a very good
place to start.
