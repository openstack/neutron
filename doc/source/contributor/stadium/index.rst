Neutron Stadium
================

This section contains information on policies and procedures for the so called
Neutron Stadium. The Neutron Stadium is the list of projects that show up in
the OpenStack `Governance Document <https://governance.openstack.org/tc/reference/projects/neutron.html>`_.

The list includes projects that the Neutron PTL and core team are directly
involved in, and manage on a day to day basis. To do so, the PTL and team
ensure that common practices and guidelines are followed throughout the
Stadium, for all aspects that pertain software development, from inception,
to coding, testing, documentation and more.

The Stadium is not to be intended as a VIP club for OpenStack networking
projects, or an upper tier within OpenStack. It is simply the list of projects
the Neutron team and PTL claim responsibility for when producing Neutron
deliverables throughout the release `cycles <https://github.com/openstack/releases>`_.

For more details on the Stadium, and what it takes for a project to be
considered an integral part of the Stadium, please read on.
