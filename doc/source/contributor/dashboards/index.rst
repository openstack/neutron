Grafana Dashboards
------------------

Look for neutron and networking-* dashboard by names by going to the following link:

`Grafana <http://grafana.openstack.org/>`_

For instance:

* `Neutron <http://grafana.openstack.org/dashboard/db/neutron-failure-rate>`_
* `Neutron-lib <http://grafana.openstack.org/dashboard/db/neutron-lib-failure-rate>`_
