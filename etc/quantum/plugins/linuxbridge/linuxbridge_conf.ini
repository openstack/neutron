# This line MUST be changed to actually run the plugin.
# Example:
# sql_connection = mysql://root:nova@127.0.0.1:3306/quantum_linux_bridge
# Replace 127.0.0.1 above with the IP address of the database used by the
# main quantum server. (Leave it as is if the database runs on this host.)

# Database reconnection retry times - in event connectivity is lost
# set to -1 implies an infinite retry count
# sql_max_retries = 10
# Database reconnection interval in seconds - in event connectivity is lost

[LINUX_BRIDGE]
# This is the interface connected to the switch on your Quantum network

[AGENT]
# Agent's polling interval in seconds

# Change to "sudo quantum-rootwrap" to limit commands that can be run
