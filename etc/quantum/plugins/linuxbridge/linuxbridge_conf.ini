[VLANS]
# (StrOpt) Type of network to allocate for tenant networks. The
# default value 'local' is useful only for single-box testing and
# provides no connectivity between hosts. You MUST change this to
# 'vlan' and configure network_vlan_ranges below in order for tenant
# networks to provide connectivity between hosts. Set to 'none' to
# disable creation of tenant networks.
#
# Default: tenant_network_type = local
# Example: tenant_network_type = vlan

# (ListOpt) Comma-separated list of
# <physical_network>[:<vlan_min>:<vlan_max>] tuples enumerating ranges
# of VLAN IDs on named physical networks that are available for
# allocation. All physical networks listed are available for flat and
# VLAN provider network creation. Specified ranges of VLAN IDs are
# available for tenant network allocation if tenant_network_type is
# 'vlan'. If empty, only local networks may be created.
#
# Default: network_vlan_ranges =
# Example: network_vlan_ranges = physnet1:1000:2999

[DATABASE]
# This line MUST be changed to actually run the plugin.
# Example:
# sql_connection = mysql://root:nova@127.0.0.1:3306/quantum_linux_bridge
# Replace 127.0.0.1 above with the IP address of the database used by the
# main quantum server. (Leave it as is if the database runs on this host.)

# sql_idle_timeout = 3600
# Maximum number of SQL connections to keep open in a QueuePool in SQLAlchemy
# Example sqlalchemy_pool_size = 5
# Maximum number of overflow connections in a QueuePool in SQLAlchemy
# Example sqlalchemy_max_overflow = 10
# Timeout of the open connections QueuePool in SQLAlchemy
# Example sqlalchemy_pool_timeout = 30

[LINUX_BRIDGE]
# (ListOpt) Comma-separated list of
# <physical_network>:<physical_interface> tuples mapping physical
# network names to the agent's node-specific physical network
# interfaces to be used for flat and VLAN networks. All physical
# networks listed in network_vlan_ranges on the server should have
# mappings to appropriate interfaces on each agent.

# Default: physical_interface_mappings =
# Example: physical_interface_mappings = physnet1:eth1

[AGENT]
# Agent's polling interval in seconds
