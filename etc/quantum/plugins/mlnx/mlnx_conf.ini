# (StrOpt) Type of network to allocate for tenant networks. The
# default value is 'vlan'  You MUST configure network_vlan_ranges below
# in order for tenant networks to provide connectivity between hosts.
# Set to 'none' to disable creation of tenant networks.
#
# Default: tenant_network_type = vlan
# Example: tenant_network_type = vlan

# (ListOpt) Comma-separated list of
# <physical_network>[:<vlan_min>:<vlan_max>] tuples enumerating ranges
# of VLAN IDs on named physical networks that are available for
# allocation. All physical networks listed are available for flat and
# VLAN provider network creation. Specified ranges of VLAN IDs are
# available for tenant network allocation if tenant_network_type is
# 'vlan'. If empty, only local networks may be created.
#
# Default: network_vlan_ranges =
# Example: network_vlan_ranges = default:1:100

[DATABASE]
# This line MUST be changed to actually run the plugin.
# Example:
# sql_connection = mysql://root:nova@127.0.0.1:3306/quantum_linux_bridge
# Replace 127.0.0.1 above with the IP address of the database used by the
# main quantum server. (Leave it as is if the database runs on this host.)
sql_connection = sqlite://
# Database reconnection retry times - in event connectivity is lost
# set to -1 implies an infinite retry count
# sql_max_retries = 10
# Database reconnection interval in seconds - in event connectivity is lost

[ESWITCH]
# (ListOpt) Comma-separated list of
# <physical_network>:<physical_interface> tuples mapping physical
# network names to the agent's node-specific physical network
# interfaces to be used for flat and VLAN networks. All physical
# networks listed in network_vlan_ranges on the server should have
# mappings to appropriate interfaces on each agent.
#
# Default: physical_interface_mappings =
# Example: physical_interface_mappings = default:eth2

# (StrOpt) Type of Network Interface to allocate for VM:
# direct or hosdev according to libvirt terminology
# Default: vnic_type = direct

# (StrOpt) Eswitch daemon end point connection url
# Default: daemon_endpoint = 'tcp://127.0.0.1:5001'

# The number of milliseconds the agent will wait for
# response on request to daemon
# Default: request_timeout = 3000


[AGENT]
# Agent's polling interval in seconds
