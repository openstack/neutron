[OVS]
# (StrOpt) Type of network to allocate for tenant networks. The
# default value 'local' is useful only for single-box testing and
# provides no connectivity between hosts. You MUST either change this
# to 'vlan' and configure network_vlan_ranges below or change this to
# 'gre' and configure tunnel_id_ranges below in order for tenant
# networks to provide connectivity between hosts. Set to 'none' to
# disable creation of tenant networks.
#
# Default: tenant_network_type = local
# Example: tenant_network_type = gre

# (ListOpt) Comma-separated list of
# <physical_network>[:<vlan_min>:<vlan_max>] tuples enumerating ranges
# of VLAN IDs on named physical networks that are available for
# allocation. All physical networks listed are available for flat and
# VLAN provider network creation. Specified ranges of VLAN IDs are
# available for tenant network allocation if tenant_network_type is
# 'vlan'. If empty, only gre and local networks may be created.
#
# Default: network_vlan_ranges =
# Example: network_vlan_ranges = physnet1:1000:2999

# (BoolOpt) Set to True in the server and the agents to enable support
# for GRE networks. Requires kernel support for OVS patch ports and
# GRE tunneling.
#
# Default: enable_tunneling = False

# (ListOpt) Comma-separated list of <tun_min>:<tun_max> tuples
# enumerating ranges of GRE tunnel IDs that are available for tenant
# network allocation if tenant_network_type is 'gre'.
#
# Default: tunnel_id_ranges =
# Example: tunnel_id_ranges = 1:1000

# This is the name of the OVS integration bridge. There is one per hypervisor.

# connectivity.

# (ListOpt) Comma-separated list of <physical_network>:<bridge> tuples
# mapping physical network names to the agent's node-specific OVS
# bridge names to be used for flat and VLAN networks. The length of
# bridge names should be no more than 11. Each bridge must
# exist, and should have a physical network interface configured as a
# port. All physical networks listed in network_vlan_ranges on the
