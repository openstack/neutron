# Config file for Quantum PLUMgrid plugin

[DATABASE]
# This line MUST be changed to actually run the plugin.
# Example:
# sql_connection = mysql://<user>:<pass>@<host>:3306/plumgrid_quantum
# Replace <host> above with the IP address of the database used by the
# main quantum server.
# sql_connection = sqlite://
# Database reconnection retry times - in event connectivity is lost
# set to -1 implies an infinite retry count
# sql_max_retries = 10
# Database reconnection interval in seconds - if the initial connection to the
# database fails
# reconnect_interval = 2
# Enable the use of eventlet's db_pool for MySQL. The flags sql_min_pool_size,
# sql_max_pool_size and sql_idle_timeout are relevant only if this is enabled.
# sql_dbpool_enable = False
# Minimum number of SQL connections to keep open in a pool
# sql_min_pool_size = 1
# Maximum number of SQL connections to keep open in a pool
# sql_max_pool_size = 5
# Timeout in seconds before idle sql connections are reaped
# sql_idle_timeout = 3600
# Maximum number of SQL connections to keep open in a QueuePool in SQLAlchemy
# Example sqlalchemy_pool_size = 5
# Maximum number of overflow connections in a QueuePool in SQLAlchemy
# Example sqlalchemy_max_overflow = 10
# Timeout of the open connections QueuePool in SQLAlchemy
# Example sqlalchemy_pool_timeout = 30

[PLUMgridNOS]
# This line should be pointing to the NOS server,

# Authentification parameters for the NOS server.
# These are the admin credentials to manage and control
