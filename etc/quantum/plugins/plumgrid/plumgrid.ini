# Example:
# connection = mysql://<user>:<pass>@<host>:3306/plumgrid_quantum

# main quantum server.
# connection = sqlite://
# Database reconnection retry times - in event connectivity is lost
# set to -1 implies an infinite retry count

# database fails
# retry_interval = 2
# Minimum number of SQL connections to keep open in a pool
# min_pool_size = 1
# Maximum number of SQL connections to keep open in a pool
# max_pool_size = 5
# Timeout in seconds before idle sql connections are reaped
# idle_timeout = 3600
