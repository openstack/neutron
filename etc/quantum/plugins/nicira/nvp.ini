# <pw> is the user password.
# <req_timeout>: The total time limit on all operations for a controller

#   Default is 30.
# <http_timeout>: How long to wait before aborting an unresponsive controller
#   (and allow for retries to another controller in the cluster).

# <retries>: the maximum number of times to retry a particular request
#   Default is 2.
