[hyperv]
# (StrOpt) Type of network to allocate for tenant networks. The
# default value 'local' is useful only for single-box testing and
# provides no connectivity between hosts. You MUST either change this
# to 'vlan' and configure network_vlan_ranges below or to 'flat'.
# Set to 'none' to disable creation of tenant networks.

# Example: tenant_network_type = vlan

# (ListOpt) Comma-separated list of
# <physical_network>[:<vlan_min>:<vlan_max>] tuples enumerating ranges
# of VLAN IDs on named physical networks that are available for
# allocation. All physical networks listed are available for flat and
# VLAN provider network creation. Specified ranges of VLAN IDs are
# available for tenant network allocation if tenant_network_type is
# 'vlan'. If empty, only gre and local networks may be created.

# Agent's polling interval in seconds

# (ListOpt) Comma separated list of <physical_network>:<vswitch>
# where the physical networks can be expressed with wildcards,
# e.g.: ."*:external".
# The referred external virtual switches need to be already present on
# the Hyper-V server.
# If a given physical network name will not match any value in the list
# the plugin will look for a virtual switch with the same name.
