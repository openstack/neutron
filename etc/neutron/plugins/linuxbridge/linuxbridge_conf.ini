[vlans]
# (StrOpt) Type of network to allocate for tenant networks. The
# default value 'local' is useful only for single-box testing and
# provides no connectivity between hosts. You MUST change this to
# 'vlan' and configure network_vlan_ranges below in order for tenant
# networks to provide connectivity between hosts. Set to 'none' to
# disable creation of tenant networks.
#
# tenant_network_type = local
# Example: tenant_network_type = vlan

# (ListOpt) Comma-separated list of
# <physical_network>[:<vlan_min>:<vlan_max>] tuples enumerating ranges
# of VLAN IDs on named physical networks that are available for
# allocation. All physical networks listed are available for flat and
# VLAN provider network creation. Specified ranges of VLAN IDs are
# available for tenant network allocation if tenant_network_type is
# 'vlan'. If empty, only local networks may be created.
#
# network_vlan_ranges =
# Example: network_vlan_ranges = physnet1:1000:2999

[linux_bridge]
# (ListOpt) Comma-separated list of
# <physical_network>:<physical_interface> tuples mapping physical
# network names to the agent's node-specific physical network
# interfaces to be used for flat and VLAN networks. All physical
# networks listed in network_vlan_ranges on the server should have
# mappings to appropriate interfaces on each agent.
#
# physical_interface_mappings =
# Example: physical_interface_mappings = physnet1:eth1

[agent]
# Agent's polling interval in seconds
# polling_interval = 2

# (BoolOpt) Enable server RPC compatibility with old (pre-havana)
# agents.
#
# rpc_support_old_agents = True
# Example: rpc_support_old_agents = False

[securitygroup]
# Firewall driver for realizing neutron security group function
# firewall_driver = neutron.agent.firewall.NoopFirewallDriver
# Example: firewall_driver = neutron.agent.linux.iptables_firewall.IptablesFirewallDriver
