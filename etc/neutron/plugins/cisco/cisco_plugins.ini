# (StrOpt) A short prefix to prepend to the VLAN number when creating a
# VLAN interface. For example, if an interface is being created for
# VLAN 2001 it will be named 'q-2001' using the default prefix.
#
# vlan_name_prefix = q-
# Example: vlan_name_prefix = vnet-

# (StrOpt) A short prefix to prepend to the VLAN number when creating a
# provider VLAN interface. For example, if an interface is being created
# for provider VLAN 3003 it will be named 'p-3003' using the default prefix.
#
# provider_vlan_name_prefix = p-
# Example: provider_vlan_name_prefix = PV-

# (BoolOpt) A flag indicating whether Openstack networking should manage the
# creation and removal of VLAN interfaces for provider networks on the Nexus
# switches. If the flag is set to False then Openstack will not create or
# remove VLAN interfaces for provider networks, and the administrator needs
# to manage these interfaces manually or by external orchestration.
#
# provider_vlan_auto_create = True

# (BoolOpt) A flag indicating whether Openstack networking should manage
# the adding and removing of provider VLANs from trunk ports on the Nexus
# switches. If the flag is set to False then Openstack will not add or
# remove provider VLANs from trunk ports, and the administrator needs to
# manage these operations manually or by external orchestration.

# the Cisco neutron plugin.

# the Cisco Nexus switches.
#
# If no value is configured, a fake driver will be used.
# nexus_driver = neutron.plugins.cisco.test.nexus.fake_nexus_driver.CiscoNEXUSFakeDriver
# With real hardware, use the CiscoNEXUSDriver class:
# nexus_driver = neutron.plugins.cisco.nexus.cisco_nexus_network_driver_v2.CiscoNEXUSDriver

# (BoolOpt) A flag to enable Layer 3 support on the Nexus switches.
# Note: This feature is not supported on all models/versions of Cisco
# Nexus switches. To use this feature, all of the Nexus switches in the
# deployment must support it.

# Cisco Nexus Switch configurations.
# Each switch to be managed by Openstack Neutron must be configured here.
#
# Cisco Nexus Switch Format.
# [NEXUS_SWITCH:<IP address of switch>]
# <hostname>=<port>                 (1)
# ssh_port=<ssh port>               (2)
# username=<credential username>    (3)
# password=<credential password>    (4)
#
# (1) For each host connected to a port on the switch, specify the hostname
#     and the Nexus physical port (interface) it is connected to.
# (2) The TCP port for connecting via SSH to manage the switch. This is
#     port number 22 unless the switch has been configured otherwise.
# (3) The username for logging into the switch to manage it.
# (4) The password for logging into the switch to manage it.
#
# Example:
# [NEXUS_SWITCH:1.1.1.1]
# compute1=1/1
# compute2=1/2
# ssh_port=22
# username=admin
# password=mySecretPassword

#
# N1KV Format.
# [N1KV:<IP address of VSM>]
# username=<credential username>
# password=<credential password>
#
# Example:
# [N1KV:2.2.2.2]
# username=admin
# password=mySecretPassword

# (StrOpt) Time in seconds for which the plugin polls the VSM for updates in
# policy profiles.

# poll_duration =
# Example: poll_duration = 180

# (IntOpt) Timeout duration in seconds for the http request
