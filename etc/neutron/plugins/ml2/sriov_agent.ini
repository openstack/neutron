# (ListOpt) Comma-separated list of <network_device>:<vfs__to_exclude>
# tuples, mapping network_device to the agent's node-specific list of virtual
# functions that should not be used for virtual networking.
# vfs_to_exclude is a semicolon-separated list of virtual
# functions to exclude from network_device. The network_device in the
# mapping should appear in the physical_device_mappings list.
