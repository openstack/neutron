# (ListOpt) Comma-separated list of <physical_network>:<network_device>
# tuples mapping physical network names to the agent's node-specific
# physical network device interfaces of SR-IOV physical function to be used
# for VLAN networks. All physical networks listed in network_vlan_ranges on
# the server should have mappings to appropriate interfaces on each agent.

# Example: physical_device_mappings = physnet1:eth1

# (ListOpt) Comma-separated list of <network_device>:<vfs__to_exclude>
# tuples, mapping network_device to the agent's node-specific list of virtual
# functions that should not be used for virtual networking.
# vfs_to_exclude is a semicolon-separated list of virtual
# functions to exclude from network_device. The network_device in the
# mapping should appear in the physical_device_mappings list.

# Example: exclude_devices = eth1:0000:07:00.2; 0000:07:00.3
