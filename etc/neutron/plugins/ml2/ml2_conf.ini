# but provides no connectivity between hosts.

# =========== items for MTU selection and advertisement =============
# (IntOpt) Path MTU.  The maximum permissible size of an unfragmented
# packet travelling from and to addresses where encapsulated Neutron
# traffic is sent.  Drivers calculate maximum viable MTU for
# validating tenant requests based on this value (typically,
# path_mtu - max encap header size).  If <=0, the path MTU is
# indeterminate and no calculation takes place.
# path_mtu = 0

# (IntOpt) Segment MTU.  The maximum permissible size of an
# unfragmented packet travelling a L2 network segment.  If <=0,
# the segment MTU is indeterminate and no calculation takes place.
# segment_mtu = 0

# (ListOpt) Physical network MTUs.  List of mappings of physical
# network to MTU value.  The format of the mapping is
# <physnet>:<mtu val>.  This mapping allows specifying a
# physical network MTU value that differs from the default
# segment_mtu value.
# physical_network_mtus =
# Example: physical_network_mtus = physnet1:1550, physnet2:1500
# ======== end of items for MTU selection and advertisement =========

# (StrOpt) Default network type for external networks when no provider
# attributes are specified. By default it is None, which means that if
# provider attributes are not specified while creating external networks

# Allowed values for external_network_type config option depend on the
# network type values configured in type_drivers config option.

# (ListOpt) List of <physical_network>[:<vlan_min>:<vlan_max>] tuples

# (StrOpt) Multicast group for the VXLAN interface. When configured, will
