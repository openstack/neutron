# (ListOpt) Comma-separated list of
# <physical_network>:<physical_interface> tuples mapping physical
# network names to the agent's node-specific physical network
# interfaces to be used for flat and VLAN networks. All physical
# networks listed in network_vlan_ranges on the server should have
# mappings to appropriate interfaces on each agent.

# Example: physical_interface_mappings = default:eth2

# The number of milliseconds the agent will wait for
# response on request to daemon

# Agent's polling interval in seconds
