# Specifies in which mode the plugin needs to operate in order to provide DHCP and
# metadata proxy services to tenant instances. If 'agent' is chosen (default)
# the NSX plugin relies on external RPC agents (i.e. dhcp and metadata agents) to
# provide such services. In this mode, the plugin supports API extensions 'agent'
# and 'dhcp_agent_scheduler'. If 'agentless' is chosen (experimental in Icehouse),
# the plugin will use NSX logical services for DHCP and metadata proxy. This
# simplifies the deployment model for Neutron, in that the plugin no longer requires
# the RPC agents to operate. When 'agentless' is chosen, the config option metadata_mode
# becomes ineffective. The 'agentless' mode is supported from NSX 4.2 or above.
# Furthermore, a 'combined' mode is also provided and is used to support existing
# deployments that want to adopt the agentless mode going forward. With this mode,
# existing networks keep being served by the existing infrastructure (thus preserving
# backward compatibility, whereas new networks will be served by the new infrastructure.
# Migration tools are provided to 'move' one network from one model to another; with
# agent_mode set to 'combined', option 'network_auto_schedule' in neutron.conf is
