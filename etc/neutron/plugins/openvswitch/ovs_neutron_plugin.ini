# (StrOpt) Type of network to allocate for tenant networks. The
# default value 'local' is useful only for single-box testing and
# provides no connectivity between hosts. You MUST either change this
# to 'vlan' and configure network_vlan_ranges below or change this to
# 'gre' or 'vxlan' and configure tunnel_id_ranges below in order for
# tenant networks to provide connectivity between hosts. Set to 'none'
# to disable creation of tenant networks.

# tenant_network_type = local
# Example: tenant_network_type = gre
# Example: tenant_network_type = vxlan

# (ListOpt) Comma-separated list of
# <physical_network>[:<vlan_min>:<vlan_max>] tuples enumerating ranges
# of VLAN IDs on named physical networks that are available for
# allocation. All physical networks listed are available for flat and
# VLAN provider network creation. Specified ranges of VLAN IDs are
# available for tenant network allocation if tenant_network_type is
# 'vlan'. If empty, only gre, vxlan and local networks may be created.
#
# network_vlan_ranges =
# Example: network_vlan_ranges = physnet1:1000:2999

# (BoolOpt) Set to True in the server and the agents to enable support
