# Specifies in which mode the plugin needs to operate in order to provide DHCP and
# metadata proxy services to tenant instances. If 'agent' is chosen (default)
# the NVP plugin relies on external RPC agents (i.e. dhcp and metadata agents) to
# provide such services. In this mode, the plugin supports API extensions 'agent'
# and 'dhcp_agent_scheduler'. If 'agentless' is chosen (experimental in Havana),
# the plugin will use NVP logical services for DHCP and metadata proxy. This
# simplifies the deployment model for Neutron, in that the plugin no longer requires
# the RPC agents to operate. When 'agentless' is chosen, the config option metadata_mode
# becomes ineffective. The mode 'agentless' is not supported for NVP 3.2 or below.

# Neutron instance will be disabled.

# Minimum delay, in seconds, between two status synchronization requests for NVP.
# Depending on chunk size, controller load, and other factors, state
# synchronization requests might be pretty heavy. This means the
