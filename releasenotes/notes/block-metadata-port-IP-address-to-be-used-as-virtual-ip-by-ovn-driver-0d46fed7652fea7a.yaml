    When ML2/OVN backend is used, usage of the metadata port IP address as a
    virtual IP address is blocked. That means that setting such IP address as
    allowed_address_pair for other port is not allowed and API will return 400
    error in such case. For more information, see bug
    `2116249 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/2116249>`_.
