fixes:
  - |
    The following ignored options have been fixed, and now these are used by
    metadata services.

    - ``[DEFAULT] metadata_backlog``
    - ``[DEFAULT] metadata_workers``


upgrade:
  - |
    In recent releases of neutron metadata server services launch worker
    threads instead of worker processes. (2025.1 for metadata-agent and
    2025.2 for ovn-metadata-agent and ovn-agent). Due to the different
    concurrency mechanism the ``[DEFAULT] metadata_workers`` may need to be
    re-evaluated, especially when it was tuned in an older version.
