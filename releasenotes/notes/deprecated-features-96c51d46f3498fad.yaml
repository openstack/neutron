  - The FWaaS API is marked as experimental for Liberty. Further, the current
    API will be removed in Mitaka and replaced with a new FWaaS API, which the
    team is in the process of developing.
  - The LBaaS V1 API is marked as deprecated and is planned to be removed in
    a future release. Going forward, the LBaaS V2 API should be used.
