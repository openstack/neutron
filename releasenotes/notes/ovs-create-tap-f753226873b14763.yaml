features:
  - |
    Added a new configuration flag: ``[ovn]ovs_create_tap``. This flag
    controls the flag with the same name added to the ML2/OVN port
    ``vif_details`` dictionary during the port binding. Nova compute will pre-
    create the TAP device if enabled. It is disabled by default. This flag is
    only available for kernel OVS; it is not present for OVS DPDK nor hardware
    offloaded OVS.
deprecations:
  - |
    The flag ``[ovn]ovs_create_tap`` is deprecated and will be removed in
    2027.1. The default behaviour will be enabled.
