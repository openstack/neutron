    ML2/OVN now supports allowed address pairs with virtual MAC addresses.
    This functionality requires OVN v26.03, that includes the support for
    VRRPv3 protocol. In systems with older OVN versions, the port security
    for this specific allowed address pair will return an invalid syntax error
    and the port won't accept traffic for the IP+MAC tuple, as it was happening
    before.
