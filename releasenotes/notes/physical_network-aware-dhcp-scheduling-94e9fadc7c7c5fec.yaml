    Schedule networks on dhcp-agents with access to network
features:
  - DHCP schedulers use "filter_host_with_network_access" plugin method to
    filter hosts with access to dhcp network. Plugins can overload it to
    define their own filtering logic. In particular, ML2 plugin delegates
    the filtering to mechanism drivers.
