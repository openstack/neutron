    The ``neutron-ovn-db-sync`` utility only manages OVN ACL rules containing
    the ``neutron:security_group_rule_id`` key in external_ids. Any ACL rules
    lacking this key are treated as external and will remain untouched by the
    synchronization process. Consequently, these rules will not be automatically
    removed, which may affect the intended behavior of the security groups
    created in Neutron.
