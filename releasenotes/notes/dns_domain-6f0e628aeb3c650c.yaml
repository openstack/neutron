    Previously a network's dns_domain attribute was ignored by the DHCP agent.
    With this release, OpenStack deployments using Neutron's DHCP agent will
    be able to specify a per network dns_domain and have instances configure
    that domain in their dns resolver configuration files (Linux's
    /etc/resolv.conf) to allow for local partial DNS lookups. The per-network
    dns_domain value will override the DHCP agent's default dns_domain
    configuration value. Note that it's also possible to update a network's
    dns_domain, and that new value will be propogated to new instances
    or when instances renew their DHCP lease. However, existing leases will
    live on with the old dns_domain value.
