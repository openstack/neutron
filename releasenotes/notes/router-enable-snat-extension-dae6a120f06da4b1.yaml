    The new ``router-enable-snat`` extension API definition has been added. This
    extension makes public the router "enable_snat" boolean field. This field
    can be set during the router creation or updated when adding/updating the
    router gateways. Although the API allows to define a different value per
    gateway port (a router can have multiple gateways), only the first one will
    apply (this is a router level configuration flag).
