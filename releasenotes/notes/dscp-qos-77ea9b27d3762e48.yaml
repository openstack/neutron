    A new rule has been added to the API that allows for tagging
    traffic with DSCP values. This is currently supported by the
    Open vSwitch QoS driver.
features:
  - Neutron can apply a QoS rule to ports that mark outgoing
    traffic's type of service packet header field.
  - The Open vSwitch Neutron agent has been extended to mark the Type of
    Service IP header field of packets egressing from the VM when the
    QoS rule has been applied.
