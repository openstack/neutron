prelude: >
  Several NICs per physical network can be used with SR-IOV.
fixes:
  - The 'physical_device_mappings' of sriov_nic configuration now can accept
    more than one NIC per physical network. For example, if 'physnet2' is
    connected to enp1s0f0 and enp1s0f1, 'physnet2:enp1s0f0,physnet2:enp1s0f1'
    will be a valid option.
