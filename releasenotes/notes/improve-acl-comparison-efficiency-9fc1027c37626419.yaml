    Neutron uses a new algorithm to compare the differences between security
    group rules in Neutron and ACLs in OVN. Before comparison, the data is
    sorted according to the security group rule ID, then the two ordered
    arrays are compared. This increases efficiency when larger sets of rules
    need to be synchronized.
