    For OVN DPDK ports, live migration activation strategy that expects a RARP
    frame sent by QEMU is no longer used. This is because for DPDK ports, QEMU
    does not send a RARP frame, which affects the time to recover network
    connectivity for DPDK ports after live migration is complete. Note that
    because of the change, some low number of duplicate packets from these
    ports may be observed during live migration.
