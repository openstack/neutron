Introduction
------------

This plugin implementation provides the following capabilities
to help you take your Layer 2 network for a Quantum leap:

* A reference implementation for a Quantum Plugin Framework
(For details see: http://wiki.openstack.org/quantum-multi-switch-plugin)
* Supports multiple switches in the network
* Supports multiple models of switches concurrently
* Supports use of multiple L2 technologies
* Supports Cisco UCS blade servers with M81KR Virtual Interface Cards 
  (aka "Palo adapters") via 802.1Qbh.
* Supports the Cisco Nexus family of switches.

It does not provide:

* A hologram of Al that only you can see.
* A map to help you find your way through time.
* A cure for amnesia or your swiss-cheesed brain.

Let's leap in!

Pre-requisites
--------------
(The following are necessary only when using the UCS and/or Nexus devices in your system.
If you plan to just leverage the plugin framework, you do not need these.)
* One or more UCS B200 series blade servers with M81KR VIC (aka 
  Palo adapters) installed.
* UCSM 2.0 (Capitola) Build 230 or above.
* OpenStack Diablo D3 or later (should have VIF-driver support)
* RHEL 6.1 (as of this writing, UCS only officially supports RHEL, but
  it should be noted that Ubuntu support is planned in coming releases as well)
  ** Package: python-configobj-4.6.0-3.el6.noarch (or newer)
  ** Package: python-routes-1.12.3-2.el6.noarch (or newer)

If you are using a Nexus switch in your topology, you'll need the following 
NX-OS version and packages to enable Nexus support:
* NX-OS 5.2.1 (Delhi) Build 69 or above.
* paramiko library - SSHv2 protocol library for python
  ** To install on RHEL 6.1, run: yum install python-paramiko
* ncclient v0.3.1 - Python library for NETCONF clients 
  ** You need a version of ncclient modifed by Cisco Systems.
     To get it, from your shell prompt do:

     git clone git@github.com:CiscoSystems/ncclient.git
     sudo python ./setup.py install

  ** For more information of ncclient, see:
     http://schmizz.net/ncclient/

To verify the version of any package you have installed on your system,
run "rpm -qav | grep <package name>", where <package name> is the 
package you want to query (for example: python-routes).

Note that you can get access to recent versions of the packages above
and other OpenStack software packages by adding a new repository to 
your yum configuration.  To do so, edit or create 
/etc/yum.repos.d/openstack.repo and add the following:

[openstack-deps]
name=OpenStack Nova Compute Dependencies
baseurl=http://yum.griddynamics.net/yum/cactus/deps
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-OPENSTACK

Then run "yum install python-routes".

                       /ucs    - UCS-specific modules


Plugin Installation Instructions
----------------------------------
1.  Make a backup copy of quantum/quantum/plugins.ini.

2.  Edit quantum/quantum/plugins.ini and edit the "provider" entry to point
    to the L2Network-plugin:

provider = quantum.plugins.cisco.l2network_plugin.L2Network

3.  Configure your OpenStack installation to use the 802.1qbh VIF driver and
    Quantum-aware scheduler by editing the /etc/nova/nova.conf file with the
    following entries:

--scheduler_driver=quantum.plugins.cisco.nova.quantum_port_aware_scheduler.QuantumPortAwareScheduler
--quantum_host=127.0.0.1
--quantum_port=9696
--libvirt_vif_driver=quantum.plugins.cisco.nova.vifdirect.Libvirt802dot1QbhDriver
--libvirt_vif_type=802.1Qbh

    Note: To be able to bring up a VM on a UCS blade, you should first create a
          port for that VM using the Quantum create port API. VM creation will
          fail if an unused port is not available. If you have configured your
          Nova project with more than one network, Nova will attempt to instantiate
          the VM with one network interface (VIF) per configured network. To provide
          plugin points for each of these VIFs, you will need to create multiple
          Quantum ports, one for each of the networks, prior to starting the VM.
          However, in this case you will need to use the Cisco multiport extension
          API instead of the Quantum create port API. More details on using the
          multiport extension follow in the section on multi NIC support.

4.  To support the above configuration, you will need some Quantum modules. It's easiest
    to copy the entire quantum directory from your quantum installation into:

/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/

    This needs to be done for each nova compute node.

5.  If you want to turn on support for Cisco Nexus switches:
    5a.  Uncomment the nexus_plugin property in 
         quantum/plugins/cisco/conf/plugins.ini to read:

nexus_plugin=quantum.plugins.cisco.nexus.cisco_nexus_plugin.NexusPlugin

    5b.  Enter the relevant configuration in the 
         quantum/plugins/cisco/conf/nexus.ini file.  Example:

[SWITCH]
# Change the following to reflect the IP address of the Nexus switch.
# This will be the address at which Quantum sends and receives configuration
# information via SSHv2.
nexus_ip_address=10.0.0.1
# Port numbers on the Nexus switch to each one of the UCSM 6120s is connected
# Use shortened interface syntax, e.g. "1/10" not "Ethernet1/10".
nexus_first_port=1/10
nexus_second_port=1/11
#Port number where SSH will be running on the Nexus switch.  Typically this is 22
#unless you've configured your switch otherwise.
nexus_ssh_port=22

[DRIVER]
name=quantum.plugins.cisco.nexus.cisco_nexus_network_driver.CiscoNEXUSDriver

    5c.  Make sure that SSH host key of the Nexus switch is known to the
         host on which you are running the Quantum service.  You can do
         this simply by logging in to your Quantum host as the user that
         Quantum runs as and SSHing to the switch at least once.  If the
         host key changes (e.g. due to replacement of the supervisor or
         clearing of the SSH config on the switch), you may need to repeat
         this step and remove the old hostkey from ~/.ssh/known_hosts.
         
6.  Plugin Persistence framework setup:
    6a.  Create quantum_l2network database in mysql with the following command -
	
mysql -u<mysqlusername> -p<mysqlpassword> -e "create database quantum_l2network"

    6b.  Enter the quantum_l2network database configuration info in the 
         quantum/plugins/cisco/conf/db_conn.ini file.
         
    6c.  If there is a change in the plugin configuration, service would need 
         to be restarted after dropping and re-creating the database using
         the following commands -

mysql -u<mysqlusername> -p<mysqlpassword> -e "drop database quantum_l2network"
mysql -u<mysqlusername> -p<mysqlpassword> -e "create database quantum_l2network"

7.  Verify that you have the correct credentials for each IP address listed
    in quantum/plugins/cisco/conf/credentials.ini.  Example:

# Provide the UCSM credentials, create a separte entry for each UCSM used in your system
# UCSM IP address, username and password.
[10.0.0.2]
username=admin
password=mySecretPasswordForUCSM

# Provide the Nexus credentials, if you are using Nexus switches.
# If not this will be ignored.
[10.0.0.1]
username=admin
password=mySecretPasswordForNexus

    In general, make sure that every UCSM and Nexus switch  used in your system,
    has a credential entry in the above file. This is required for the system to
    be able to communicate with those switches.

8.  Configure the UCS systems' information in your deployment by editing the
    quantum/plugins/cisco/conf/ucs_inventory.ini file. You can configure multiple
    UCSMs per deployment, multiple chassis per UCSM, and multiple blades per
    chassis. Chassis ID and blade ID can be obtained from the UCSM (they will
    typically be numbers like 1, 2, 3, etc.). Also make sure that you put the exact
    hostname as nova sees it (the host column in the services table of the nova
    DB will give you that information).

[ucsm-1]
ip_address = <put_ucsm_ip_address_here>
[[chassis-1]]
chassis_id = <put_the_chassis_id_here>
[[[blade-1]]]
blade_id = <put_blade_id_here>
host_name = <put_hostname_here>
[[[blade-2]]] 
blade_id = <put_blade_id_here> 
host_name = <put_hostname_here> 
[[[blade-3]]]
blade_id = <put_blade_id_here>
host_name = <put_hostname_here>
         
[ucsm-2]
ip_address = <put_ucsm_ip_address_here>
[[chassis-1]]
chassis_id = <put_the_chassis_id_here>
[[[blade-1]]]
blade_id = <put_blade_id_here>
host_name = <put_hostname_here>
[[[blade-2]]]
blade_id = <put_blade_id_here>
host_name = <put_hostname_here>


9.  Start the Quantum service.  If something doesn't work, verify that
    your configuration of each of the above files hasn't gone a little kaka.
    Once you've put right what once went wrong, leap on.


Multi NIC support for VMs
-------------------------
As indicated earlier, if your Nova setup has a project with more than one network,
Nova will try to create a virtual network interface (VIF) on the VM for each of those
networks. That implies -

    (1) You should create the same number of networks in Quantum as in your Nova
        project.

    (2) Before each VM is instantiated, you should create Quantum ports on each of those
        networks. These ports need to be created using the following rest call:

POST /v1.0/extensions/csco/tenants/{tenant_id}/multiport/

with request body:

{'multiport': 
 {'status': 'ACTIVE',
  'net_id_list': net_id_list,
  'ports_desc': {'key': 'value'}}}

where,

net_id_list is a list of network IDs: [netid1, netid2, ...]. The "ports_desc" dictionary
is reserved for later use. For now, the same structure in terms of the dictionary name, key
and value should be used.

The corresponding CLI for this operation is as follows:

PYTHONPATH=. python plugins/cisco-plugin/lib/quantum/plugins/cisco/client/cli.py create_multiport <tenant_id> <net_id1,net_id2,...>
    
    (Note that you should not be using the create port core API in the above case.)


Using the Command Line Client to work with this Plugin
------------------------------------------------------
A command line client is packaged with this plugin. This module can be used
to invoke the core API as well as the extensions API, so that you don't have
to switch between different CLI modules (it internally invokes the Quantum
CLI module for the core APIs to ensure consistency when using either). This
command line client can be invoked as follows:

PYTHONPATH=.:tools python plugins/cisco-plugin/lib/quantum/plugins/cisco/client/cli.py

1.  Creating the network

# PYTHONPATH=. python plugins/cisco-plugin/lib/quantum/plugins/cisco/client/cli.py create_net -H 10.10.2.6 demo net1
Created a new Virtual Network with ID: c4a2bea7-a528-4caf-b16e-80397cd1663a
for Tenant demo


2.  Listing the networks

# PYTHONPATH=. python plugins/cisco-plugin/lib/quantum/plugins/cisco/client/cli.py list_nets -H 10.10.2.6 demo
Virtual Networks for Tenant demo
    Network ID: 0e85e924-6ef6-40c1-9f7a-3520ac6888b3
    Network ID: c4a2bea7-a528-4caf-b16e-80397cd1663a
    

3.  Creating one port on each of the networks

# PYTHONPATH=. python plugins/cisco-plugin/lib/quantum/plugins/cisco/client/cli.py create_multiport -H 10.10.2.6 demo c4a2bea7-a528-4caf-b16e-80397cd1663a,0e85e924-6ef6-40c1-9f7a-3520ac6888b3
Created ports: {u'ports': [{u'id': u'118ac473-294d-480e-8f6d-425acbbe81ae'}, {u'id': u'996e84b8-2ed3-40cf-be75-de17ff1214c4'}]}


4.  List all the ports on a network

# PYTHONPATH=. python plugins/cisco-plugin/lib/quantum/plugins/cisco/client/cli.py list_ports -H 10.10.2.6 demo c4a2bea7-a528-4caf-b16e-80397cd1663a
Ports on Virtual Network: c4a2bea7-a528-4caf-b16e-80397cd1663a
for Tenant: demo
    Logical Port: 118ac473-294d-480e-8f6d-425acbbe81ae


5.  Show the details of a port

# PYTHONPATH=. python plugins/cisco-plugin/lib/quantum/plugins/cisco/client/cli.py show_port -H 10.10.2.6 demo c4a2bea7-a528-4caf-b16e-80397cd1663a 118ac473-294d-480e-8f6d-425acbbe81ae
Logical Port ID: 118ac473-294d-480e-8f6d-425acbbe81ae
administrative State: ACTIVE
interface: <none>
on Virtual Network: c4a2bea7-a528-4caf-b16e-80397cd1663a
for Tenant: demo


6.  Start the VM instance using Nova
    Note that when using UCS and the 802.1Qbh features, the association of the
    VIF-ID (also referred to as interface ID) on the VM's NIC with a port will
    happen automatically when the VM is instantiated. At this point, doing a
    show_port will reveal the VIF-ID associated with the port. To indicate that
    this VIF-ID is still detached from the network it would eventually be on, you
    will see the suffix "(detached)" on the VIF-ID. This indicates that although
    the VIF-ID and the port have been associated, the VIF still does not have
    connectivity to the network on which the port resides. That connectivity
    will be established only after the plug/attach operation is performed (as
    described in the next step).

# PYTHONPATH=. python plugins/cisco-plugin/lib/quantum/plugins/cisco/client/cli.py show_port demo c4a2bea7-a528-4caf-b16e-80397cd1663a 118ac473-294d-480e-8f6d-425acbbe81ae
Logical Port ID: 118ac473-294d-480e-8f6d-425acbbe81ae
administrative State: ACTIVE
interface: b73e3585-d074-4379-8dde-931c0fc4db0e(detached)
on Virtual Network: c4a2bea7-a528-4caf-b16e-80397cd1663a
for Tenant: demo


7.  Plug interface and port into the network
    Use the interface information obtained in step 6 to plug the interface into
    the network.

# PYTHONPATH=. python plugins/cisco-plugin/lib/quantum/plugins/cisco/client/cli.py plug_iface demo c4a2bea7-a528-4caf-b16e-80397cd1663a 118ac473-294d-480e-8f6d-425acbbe81ae b73e3585-d074-4379-8dde-931c0fc4db0e
Plugged interface b73e3585-d074-4379-8dde-931c0fc4db0e
into Logical Port: 118ac473-294d-480e-8f6d-425acbbe81ae 
on Virtual Network: c4a2bea7-a528-4caf-b16e-80397cd1663a
for Tenant: demo


8.  Unplug an interface and port from the network

# PYTHONPATH=. python plugins/cisco-plugin/lib/quantum/plugins/cisco/client/cli.py unplug_iface demo c4a2bea7-a528-4caf-b16e-80397cd1663a 118ac473-294d-480e-8f6d-425acbbe81ae
Unplugged interface from Logical Port: 118ac473-294d-480e-8f6d-425acbbe81ae
on Virtual Network: c4a2bea7-a528-4caf-b16e-80397cd1663a
for Tenant: demo

    Note: After unplugging, if you check the details of the port, you will
    see the VIF-IF associated with the port (but now suffixed with the state
    "detached"). At this point, it is possible to plug the VIF into the network
    again making use of the same VIF-ID. In general, once associated, the VIF-ID
    cannot be disassociated with the port until the VM is terminated. After the
    VM is terminated, the VIF-ID will be automatically disassociated from the
    port. To summarize, association and disassociation of the VIF-ID with a port
    happens automatically at the time of creating and terminating the VM. The
    connectivity of the VIF to the network is controlled by the user via the
    plug and unplug operations.


How to test the installation
----------------------------
The unit tests are located at quantum/plugins/cisco/tests/unit. They can be
executed from the main folder using the run_tests.sh or to get a more detailed
result the run_tests.py script.

1. All unit tests (needs environment setup as indicated in the pre-requisites):

   ./run_tests.sh -N quantum.plugins.cisco.tests.unit

   or by modifying the environment variable to point to the plugin directory

       In bash : export PLUGIN_DIR=quantum/plugins/cisco
          tcsh/csh : setenv PLUGIN_DIR quantum/plugins/cisco

       ./run_tests.sh -N

   Another option is to execute the python script run_tests.py

   python run_tests.py quantum.plugins.cisco.tests.unit

2. Testing the core API (without UCS/Nexus/RHEL hardware, and can be run on
   Ubuntu):
   Device-specific plugins can be disabled by commenting out the entries in:
   etc/quantum/plugins/cisco/cisco_plugins.ini
   The Core API can be tested by initially disabling all device plugins, then
   enabling just the UCS plugins, and finally enabling both the UCS and the
   Nexus plugins.
   Execute the test script as follows:

   ./run_tests.sh -N quantum.plugins.cisco.tests.unit.test_l2networkApi

   or

   python run_tests.py quantum.plugins.cisco.tests.unit.test_l2networkApi

3. Specific Plugin unit test (needs environment setup as indicated in the
   pre-requisites):

   ./run_tests.sh -N quantum.plugins.cisco.tests.unit.<name_of_the_module>

   or

   python run_tests.py quantum.plugins.cisco.tests.unit.<name_of_the_module>
   E.g.:

   python run_tests.py quantum.plugins.cisco.tests.unit.test_ucs_plugin

   To run specific tests, use the following:
   python run_tests.py
    quantum.plugins.cisco.tests.unit.<name_of_the_module>:<ClassName>.<funcName>

   Eg:
   python run_tests.py
    quantum.plugins.cisco.tests.unit.test_ucs_plugin:UCSVICTestPlugin.test_create_port

4. Testing the Extension API
   The script is placed alongwith the other cisco unit tests. The location may
   change later.
   Location quantum/plugins/cisco/tests/unit/test_cisco_extension.py

   The script can be executed by :
    ./run_tests.sh -N quantum.plugins.cisco.tests.unit.test_cisco_extension

    or

    python run_tests.py quantum.plugins.cisco.tests.unit.test_cisco_extension


Bingo bango bongo!  That's it!  Thanks for taking the leap into Quantum.

...Oh, boy!
